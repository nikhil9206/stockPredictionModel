# Data Analysis and Machine Learning Project

This project involves performing various data analysis and machine learning tasks, as outlined in the objectives below. The project uses Python with popular libraries to explore data, visualize results, and apply predictive models.

## Objectives

- Perform null value checking and handle missing data.
- Conduct Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for data visualization.
- Apply linear regression and evaluate results using MSE and \( R^2 \).
- Implement ridge regression for enhanced predictions.
- Develop and evaluate neural network models.
- Perform sentiment analysis on textual data.
- Propose a research methodology.

## Notebook Summary

- **Markdown Cells**: 1 (contains project objectives and methodology overview).
- **Code Cells**: 10 (includes implementations of the listed objectives).

## How to Use

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <repository-directory>
   ```
2. Install required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Open the Jupyter Notebook (`all.ipynb`) and execute cells sequentially:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook all.ipynb
   ```

## Requirements

- Python 3.7+
- Libraries:
  - `numpy`
  - `pandas`
  - `matplotlib`
  - `seaborn`
  - `scikit-learn`

## Outputs

The notebook provides:
- Visualizations from PCA.
- Performance metrics for regression models (\( R^2 \), MSE).
- Neural network evaluation results.
- Insights from sentiment analysis.

## Future Enhancements

- Extend the scope of regression models with additional regularization techniques.
- Include more advanced neural network architectures.
- Broaden sentiment analysis to include unsupervised learning techniques.
- Refine the research proposal based on initial findings.
